When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
       To collaborate with other people on a project. When you want to share your code
    with someone, even if they just want to see the code and not contribute to
    it.  To be able to edit code from multiple computers and keep the code up-to-date on all the
    computers.  Also, remotes can be a good way to keep a backup of your work.
