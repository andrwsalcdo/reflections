When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
     To collaborate with other people on a project. When you want to share your
     code with someone, even if they just want to see the code and not
     contribute to it.  To be able to edit code from multiple computers and
     keep the code up-to-date on all the computers. Also, remotes can be a good
     way to keep a backup of your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that you can anticipate any changes to the code. For example, if new code
    in the remote repo has any problems, then you might not want to pull those
    changes until the problems are resolved.
